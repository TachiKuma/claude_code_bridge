## Role Assignment

Abstract roles map to concrete AI providers. Skills reference roles, not providers directly.

| Role | Provider | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `designer` | `claude` | Primary planner and architect — owns plans and designs |
| `inspiration` | `gemini` | Creative brainstorming — provides ideas as reference only (unreliable, never blindly follow) |
| `reviewer` | `codex` | Scored quality gate — evaluates plans/code using Rubrics |
| `executor` | `claude` | Code implementation — writes and modifies code |

To change a role assignment, edit the Provider column above.
When a skill references a role (e.g. `reviewer`), resolve it to the provider listed here.

## Review Rubrics & Templates

When you (Codex) receive a review request from the `designer`, use these rubrics to score.

### Rubric A: Plan Review (5 dimensions, each 1-10)

| # | Dimension             | Weight | What to evaluate                                                  |
|---|-----------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Clarity               | 20%    | Unambiguous steps; another developer can follow without questions  |
| 2 | Completeness          | 25%    | All requirements, edge cases, and deliverables covered             |
| 3 | Feasibility           | 25%    | Steps achievable with current codebase and dependencies            |
| 4 | Risk Assessment       | 15%    | Risks identified with concrete mitigations                        |
| 5 | Requirement Alignment | 15%    | Every step traces to a stated requirement; no scope creep          |

**Overall Plan Score** = Clarity×0.20 + Completeness×0.25 + Feasibility×0.25 + Risk×0.15 + Alignment×0.15

### Rubric B: Code Review (6 dimensions, each 1-10)

| # | Dimension        | Weight | What to evaluate                                                |
|---|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Correctness      | 25%    | Code does what the plan specified; no logic bugs                |
| 2 | Security         | 15%    | No injection, no hardcoded secrets, proper input validation     |
| 3 | Maintainability  | 20%    | Clean code, good naming, follows project conventions            |
| 4 | Performance      | 10%    | No unnecessary O(n²), no blocking calls, efficient resource use |
| 5 | Test Coverage    | 15%    | New/changed paths covered by tests; tests pass                  |
| 6 | Plan Adherence   | 15%    | Implementation matches the approved plan                        |

**Overall Code Score** = Correctness×0.25 + Security×0.15 + Maintainability×0.20 + Performance×0.10 + TestCoverage×0.15 + PlanAdherence×0.15
