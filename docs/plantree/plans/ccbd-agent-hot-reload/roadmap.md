# CCBD Agent Hot Reload Roadmap

Date: 2026-05-29

## Done

- Confirmed current daemon initialization loads `.ccb/ccb.config` once and
  injects the resulting object into registry, supervisor, supervision,
  completion tracking, dispatcher, project view, and project focus services.
- Confirmed current keeper behavior treats config signature drift as a daemon
  restart trigger.
- Confirmed current namespace topology check escalates missing windows,
  changed agent pane membership, and missing sidebar panes into namespace
  recreation.
- Confirmed `[ui.sidebar.view]` is already a view-only hot-load precedent
  through `project_view`, but it does not cover agent/runtime topology.
- Recorded additive-first hot reload as the first supported target.
- Discussed the full dynamic load/unload/replace direction and recorded the
  main safety risks: handler lock contention, stale handler service captures,
  unbounded draining, unbounded pending replacement, and namespace patch drift.
- Established Phase 0 baseline diagnostics for control-plane handler latency,
  heartbeat steps, project-view work, process metrics, and reload placeholders.
- Introduced the Phase 1 config-bound service graph boundary used by startup,
  with graph version and created-at diagnostics.
- Added Phase 2 stable handler routing wrappers so request handlers resolve the
  current service graph at request time without a steady-state publish/read
  mutex.
- Added Phase 3 dry-run reload planning: `project_reload_config` accepts only
  `dry_run=true`, `ccb reload --dry-run` renders the no-mutation plan, and the
  classifier reports no-op, view-only, add, remove, replace, move/layout, and
  invalid-config cases without publishing a graph or touching tmux/runtime
  authority.
- Added Phase 4 bounded drain/retire state machinery: a pure drain queue model
  with timeout, pending-count, and age bounds, an explicit `reload-drain.json`
  store, injectable busy predicate transitions, retired terminal state, and
  dry-run drain intent suggestions for unload/replace plans. Phase 4 still does
  not publish a graph, patch namespace, mutate runtime authority, or execute
  tmux operations.
- Added Phase 5 namespace patch planning foundation: dry-run payloads now
  include a deferred namespace patch plan for view-only and additive
  add-agent/add-window classes, with required project/session/slot proofs,
  preserved-agent reporting, and explicit blocks for remove/replace/move/layout.
  Mutating apply, tmux writes, runtime authority writes, agent mounting, and
  service-graph publish remain deferred.
- Added Phase 6a additive apply design: documented the transaction order,
  rollback/diagnostic behavior, pane preservation proof, reusable existing APIs,
  and required narrow APIs before non-dry-run reload can be enabled.
- Added the Phase 6b first implementation step: a fake-backend-tested
  `add_window` namespace additive patch API that creates only new
  window/sidebar/agent pane evidence and remains disconnected from
  non-dry-run `ccb reload`.
- Added append-only `add_agent` namespace additive patch apply: it requires the
  new layout to expand the last existing agent pane, splits the new managed
  agent pane from that anchor, preserves old pane evidence, and remains
  disconnected from non-dry-run reload.
- Added the Phase 6b new-agent runtime mount helper: it calls the existing
  start-flow/runtime authority path only for namespace-patch-created agent
  panes, proves preserved runtime authority is unchanged, and remains
  disconnected from non-dry-run reload.
- Added the Phase 6b signature/publish transaction helper: after successful
  namespace patch and runtime mount results, it updates the current lease and
  mounted lifecycle config signature with holder/generation checks, then
  publishes the new service graph.
- Added the Phase 6b internal additive apply orchestrator: it builds the
  dry-run plan and target graph, accepts only `view_only_change`, append-only
  `add_agent`, and `add_window`, then runs namespace patch, runtime mount, and
  signature/publish transaction in order. Stage failures keep the old graph
  active and return pane/runtime residue diagnostics.
- Wired the Phase 6b additive apply orchestrator into the explicit user path:
  `project_reload_config(dry_run=false)` and plain `ccb reload` now attempt
  only `view_only_change`, append-only `add_agent`, and `add_window`.
  Non-additive classes still block at plan stage, CLI output includes stage,
  graph versions, diagnostics, and residue, and successful publish invalidates
  the project-view cache.
- Added the Phase 6b keeper handoff guard: plain `ccb reload` and accepted
  daemon-side non-dry-run additive apply with a changed config signature write a
  short-lived `reload-handoff.json` while disk config has the target signature
  but daemon ping may still report the old graph signature. Keeper accepts that
  mismatch only for the matching live daemon holder and stale or mismatched
  handoffs fail closed.
- Wired sidebar's refresh control and `r` shortcut to the same explicit
  non-dry-run reload path, then refresh project view after the response. This
  lets edited configs materialize new tmux panes/windows without adding a
  background config watcher.

## In Progress

- Phase 6b additive mutating reload remains in progress for manual hardening:
  accepted user-path classes and sidebar-initiated reload are implemented, while
  daemon-pushed sidebar refresh is not signaled and unload/replace/move/layout
  remain blocked.

## Next

1. Run the automatic and manual additive reload matrix in
   [topics/test-matrix.md](topics/test-matrix.md), including `test_ccb2`
   screenshots for unchanged old panes and newly-mounted agents.
2. Add a lightweight daemon-pushed sidebar refresh signal if needed after manual
   validation; avoid polling or steady-state scans.
3. Expose dynamic unload for idle and bounded-draining agents.
4. Expose replacement only after unload semantics are safe; busy replacement
   remains pending with explicit bounds.

## Deferred

- Pane-preserving arbitrary layout reshuffle.
- Background file watching of `.ccb/ccb.config`.
- General `ccbd` control-plane performance optimization.
- Automatic replace of indefinitely busy agents without user policy.
- Cross-window movement of busy panes.
