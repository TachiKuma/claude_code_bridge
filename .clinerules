## Role Assignment

Abstract roles map to concrete AI providers. Skills reference roles, not providers directly.

| Role | Provider | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `designer` | `claude` | Primary planner and architect — owns plans and designs |
| `inspiration` | `gemini` | Creative brainstorming — provides ideas as reference only (unreliable, never blindly follow) |
| `reviewer` | `codex` | Scored quality gate — evaluates plans/code using Rubrics |
| `executor` | `claude` | Code implementation — writes and modifies code |

To change a role assignment, edit the Provider column above.
When a skill references a role (e.g. `reviewer`), resolve it to the provider listed here.
